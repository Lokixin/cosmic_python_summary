- Depend on abstractions
- The Flask API must be replaceable (for example, by a CLI). So that, the endpoints should call a service (use-case) method, which would handle database connection and domain objects. 
- This way, we can split our tests in: 
	- Web stuff (http call, status code, request params, etc).
	- Orchestration -> Service layer, fake repository, etc.

## Why is Everything called a Service?

Differences between application service and domain layer service: 
- Application service drives the application by following some simple steps: 
	- Get data from db
	- Update domain model
	- Persist any changes
We want to keep this separate from business logic. 
- Domain service: 
	- Piece of logic that belongs in the domain model but doesn't sit naturally inside a stateful entity or value object. 
	- It does not need to be a persisted entity.
	- For example: calculating taxes in a shopping cart. It is considered business logic, but it does not need a stateful entity.
