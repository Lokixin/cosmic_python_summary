- **Business logic shouldn't be spread over the place**
- Don't start by designing a database schema. Instead, behaviour should come first and drive our storage requirements. 
- First part of the book: 
	- Build a rich object model. 
	- Keep model decoupled from technical concerns. 
	- Persistence-ignorant code.
	- How to create stable APIs around our domain so that we can refactor aggressively. 
- Previous points rely on four key design patterns: 
	- Repository pattern: An abstraction over the idea of persistent storage. 
	- Service Layer: Pattern to clearly define where our use cases begin and end. 
	- The Unit of Work pattern to provide atomic operations.
	- The Aggregate pattern to enforce the integrity of our data.
