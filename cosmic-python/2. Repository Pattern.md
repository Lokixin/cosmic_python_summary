- Decouple core logic from infrastructural concerns.
- Repository pattern: A simplifying abstraction over storage -> Decouple model layer from the data layer. 
## Applying the DIP to Data Access
- In MVC, model depends on db layer. 
- Onion Architecture: Keep our model without any dependencies. Our model is inside, and dependencies flow inward to it. 

## The Normal ORM Way: Model Depends on ORM
- Our model depends (inherits) from ORM base classes. 
- We want it to be the other way around. ORM knows about the model, but model does not give a fuck about the ORM. 

## Inverting the Dependency: ORM Depends on Model
- We can define a separate schema, and a mapper. 
- The mapper knows how to convert between the schema and our domain model. 

## Introducing the Repository Pattern

- Access persistent storage as if it was an in-memory object. 
- Stops us from coupling our domain model to the database. 
- Not everything is good, it adds a new layer of abstraction and maintenance. 

```python 
class SqlAlchemyRepository(AbstractRepository):
    def __init__(self, session):
        self.session = session

    def add(self, batch):
        self.session.add(batch)

    def get(self, reference):
        return self.session.query(model.Batch).filter_by(reference=reference).one()

    def list(self):
        return self.session.query(model.Batch).all()
```

- We can build a fake repository, this allows to make test without needing an actual db. For example

```python
class FakeRepository(AbstractRepository):

    def __init__(self, batches):
        self._batches = set(batches)

    def add(self, batch):
        self._batches.add(batch)

    def get(self, reference):
        return next(b for b in self._batches if b.reference == reference)

    def list(self):
        return list(self._batches)
```
